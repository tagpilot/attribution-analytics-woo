This plugin uses modern JavaScript development tools. The distributed JavaScript files in the `build` directory are compiled from source files located in the `src` directory.

= Build from Source =

To build the JavaScript files from source:

1. Install Node.js (version 16 or higher) and npm (version 8 or higher)
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Run `npm run build` to create production builds with source maps
4. Run `npm run start` for development mode with file watching

The source code is available in the plugin's `src` directory, and the build process uses WordPress Scripts (@wordpress/scripts) for bundling and compilation.
